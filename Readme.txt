Project Description: My project is called Dragon Ball Z: Sukaidesutoroiyā, Which means Sky Destroyer in Japanese. 
It is a video game made in pygame which uses the famous flappy bird mechanics to follow the journey of the most 
powerful Saiyan’s in the universe: Goku, Vegeta, and Broly through the some of the most famous locations in the Dragon Ball Z universe. 
You have to jump through the pipes. The aim of the player is to get the highest score possible by jumping through the pipes as many times as possible.

How to run the project: The user should run the project file, it is the only python file with the game. You should put all the sounds in a folder called sounds. Put all the pictures such as jpg, png, gif, jpeg in a folder called Pics. Once you have done that, put the python file code, sounds, and Pics in 1 folder named as you like and enjoy

How to install any needed libraries: sys and random come with python version 3. You need to install pygames by
going to this link (https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) You can then download from the link and you the command prompt
to install it into your python by writing pip install pygames.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist: You use the spacebar to play the game by jumping up and then falling down.
You can also press escape at any moment to go back to the menu screen when in game.
